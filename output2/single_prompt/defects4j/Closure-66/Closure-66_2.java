All of the functions in this code are too complicated to provide quick fixes. However, the following general approaches can be taken to fix them:

1. Ensure proper type checking: The code should thoroughly check and handle all the possible types of data that can be passed or returned by a function. This ensures the correctness of the code.

2. Simplify the logic: The code should be made simpler and more straightforward by removing any redundant or unnecessary steps in the logic.

3. Use descriptive variable names: The variables used should be given meaningful names that can easily be understood by anyone reading the code.

4. Avoid using switch statements: Instead of switch statements, use if-else statements which can be easier to read and understand.

5. Break up large functions: Large functions can be difficult to understand. Consider breaking them down into smaller functions that each perform a specific task.

6. Remove unnecessary code: Remove any code that does not have any effect on the output of the function.
