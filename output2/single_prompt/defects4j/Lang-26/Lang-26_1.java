## Fixed Function 1
public String format(Date date) {
    Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);
    c.setTime(date);
    return applyRules(c, new StringBuilder(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();
}

## Explanation
The original code uses `StringBuffer` which is a thread-safe class for modifying strings. However, in this specific scenario, there is no need for thread-safety and using `StringBuilder` instead provides better performance. Therefore, simply replacing `StringBuffer` with `StringBuilder` fixes the issue.
