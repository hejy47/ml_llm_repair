There are multiple issues with the `pow` function, making it difficult to provide a specific fix. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Replace calls to `log` and `exp` functions with the `Math.log` and `Math.exp` functions provided by Java's standard library. This would eliminate the need for the `lns` array and remove any implementation-specific issues with the existing functions.

2. Simplify the logic for handling specific input values, such as zero, NaN, and infinities. The existing code uses several nested if-else blocks that could be simplified by using switch statements or Boolean logic.

3. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability. The existing function is over 100 lines long and uses several magic numbers and array indices that make it difficult to understand and modify. Breaking the function into smaller helper functions and using descriptive variable names would make it easier to understand and update over time.
