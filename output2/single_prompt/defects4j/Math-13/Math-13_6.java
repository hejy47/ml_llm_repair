## Fixed Function 1
private RealMatrix squareRoot(RealMatrix m) {
    final EigenDecomposition dec = new EigenDecomposition(m);
    final RealMatrix sqrtMatrix = dec.getSquareRoot();
    if(sqrtMatrix == null){
        throw new ArithmeticException("Matrix square root is not defined");
    }
    return sqrtMatrix;
} 

Note: A check is added to see if the square root of the matrix is null or not to avoid returning null in case of a non-existent square root. This check can also throw an exception in case the square root of the matrix is not defined.
