## Fixed Function 1
private RealMatrix squareRoot(RealMatrix m) {
    final EigenDecomposition dec = new EigenDecomposition(m);
    RealMatrix sqrtMatrix;
    try {
        sqrtMatrix = dec.getSquareRoot();
    } catch (NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException e) {
        sqrtMatrix = dec.getV().multiply(dec.getD().sqrt()).multiply(dec.getV().transpose());
    }
    return sqrtMatrix;
} 

Explanation: The original function is trying to calculate the square root of a matrix by using an EigenDecomposition object. However, if the matrix is not positive definite, this method will throw a NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException. To handle this exception, we can catch it and use an alternative method of calculating the sqrtMatrix. This alternative method uses the decomposition to calculate the product of the eigenvector matrix (V), the diagonal matrix containing the square roots of the eigenvalues (D.sqrt()), and the transpose of the eigenvector matrix (V.transpose()). This will give us a matrix that is equivalent to the square root of the original matrix, even in cases where the original matrix is not positive definite.
