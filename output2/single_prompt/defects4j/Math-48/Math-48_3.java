One potential fix for the `doSolve` method is to add a check for the maximum number of iterations, because the current implementation can potentially run into an infinite loop. 

Another potential fix is to add a check for NaN or infinity values to prevent the algorithm from continuing if these values are encountered during the computation of function values. 

Finally, it may also be useful to add additional checks for the input bounds and accuracy parameters to ensure they are valid and within reasonable ranges.
