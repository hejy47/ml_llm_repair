## Fixed Function 1
Assuming that `optimizer` is initialized properly with the desired optimization method and objective function, the code should be fixed as follows:

public double getFunctionValue(ObjectiveFunction optimizer) {
    return optimizer.computeObjectiveValue();
}

Note that we changed the method name to clarify what it actually does, and replaced `getFunctionValue()` with `computeObjectiveValue()` to reflect what the optimizer is actually doing. Also note that we added the `optimizer` parameter to avoid any possible confusion or error caused by using a global optimizer variable.

## Fixed Function 2
Assuming that `optimizer` is initialized properly with the desired optimization method and objective function, the code should be fixed as follows:

public double getResult(Optimizer optimizer) {
    return optimizer.getOptimalSolution().getValue();
}

Note that we added the `optimizer` parameter to avoid any possible confusion or error caused by using a global optimizer variable. We also used `getOptimalSolution()` instead of `getResult()`, assuming that the optimizer has a method that returns an object representing the optimal solution. We then accessed the value of that optimal solution using `getValue()`.
