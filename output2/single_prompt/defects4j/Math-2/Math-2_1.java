## Fixed Function 1
public double getNumericalMean() {
    return (double) (getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) (getSampleSize());
}

## Explanation
The original function is calculating the mean using the population size, which is incorrect if the sample size is smaller than the population size. The fixed function calculates the mean using the number of successes and the sample size, which is the correct formula for calculating the sample mean.
