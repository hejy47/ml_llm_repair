There are multiple possibilities for fixing this code, as it is not clear what exactly is causing the bug. One possible fix could be to remove the variable `forward` and always assume that the interpolator operates in the forward time direction. This would simplify the code and make it more robust to changes in the interpolator implementation. Additionally, the `UnivariateRealFunction` interface could be replaced by a lambda function to make the code shorter and more readable:

## Fixed Function 1
public boolean evaluateStep(final StepInterpolator interpolator) throws DerivativeException, EventException, ConvergenceException {
    try {
        final double t1 = interpolator.getCurrentTime();
        final int n = Math.max(1, (int) Math.ceil(Math.abs(t1 - t0) / maxCheckInterval));
        final double h = (t1 - t0) / n;
        double ta = t0;
        double ga = g0;
        double tb = t0 + (convergence * Math.signum(h));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // evaluate handler value at the end of the substep
            tb += h;
            interpolator.setInterpolatedTime(tb);
            final double gb = handler.g(tb, interpolator.getInterpolatedState());
            // check events occurrence
            if (Math.signum(g0) != Math.signum(gb)) {
                // there is a sign change: an event is expected during this step
                // this is a corner case:
                // - there was an event near ta,
                // - there is another event between ta and tb
                // - when ta was computed, convergence was reached on the "wrong side" of the interval
                // this implies that the real sign of ga is the same as gb, so we need to slightly
                // shift ta to make sure ga and gb get opposite signs and the solver won't complain
                // about bracketing
