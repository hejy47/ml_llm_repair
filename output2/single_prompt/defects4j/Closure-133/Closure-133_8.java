## Fixed Function 1
private String getRemainingJSDocLine() {
    return stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();
} 

# Explanation
The buggy function was returning a variable "result" which was unnecessary as it was simply storing the value returned by the method stream.getRemainingJSDocLine(). The fix removes the variable and directly returns the value of the method.
