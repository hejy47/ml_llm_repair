## Fixed Function 1
private String getRemainingJSDocLine() {
    String result = stream.getRemainingJSDoc();
    stream.advance(result.length());
    return result;
} 

# Explanation 
The `getRemainingJSDocLine` function was calling the `getRemainingJSDocLine` method of the `stream` object which was not defined. The fixed function calls the correct method `getRemainingJSDoc`, sets the `result` variable to the returned value, and advances the stream position by the length of the returned value.
