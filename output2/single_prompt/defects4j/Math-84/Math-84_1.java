It's difficult to determine the exact fix without more context, but here are some potential fixes:

1. The while loop may run infinitely if the optimization never converges. Consider adding a condition to break out of the loop after a certain number of iterations.
2. The `original` array is being modified when evaluating the expanded simplex. Consider creating a new array instead of modifying the original.
3. The function is missing a catch block for `FunctionEvaluationException`. Consider adding this catch block to properly handle the exception.
