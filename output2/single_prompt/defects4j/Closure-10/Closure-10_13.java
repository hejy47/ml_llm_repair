## Fixed Function 1
static boolean mayBeString(Node n, boolean recurse) {
    if (recurse) {
        return allChildResultsMatch(n, MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE);
    } else {
        return mayBeStringHelper(n);
    }
}

## Explanation
The original `mayBeString()` function is calling the function `allResultsMatch()`, which checks all the immediate child nodes of the given node `n`. However, since the function `mayBeString()` is being called with the `recurse` parameter set to true, it needs to consider all descendant nodes of `n`, not just the immediate children.

The fixed function corrects this issue by calling `allChildResultsMatch()`, which recursively checks all descendant nodes of the given node `n`.
