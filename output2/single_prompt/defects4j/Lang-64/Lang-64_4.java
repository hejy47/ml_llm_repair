## Fixed Function 1
public int compareTo(Object other) {
    if (this.getClass() != other.getClass()) {
        throw new ClassCastException("Cannot compare objects of different classes.");
    }
    return iValue - ((ValuedEnum) other).iValue;
} 

# Explanation
The fixed function includes a check to ensure that the objects being compared are of the same class before attempting to cast them to a ValuedEnum and compare their iValue attributes. This avoids a potential ClassCastException that could occur if the objects being compared are not of the same class.
