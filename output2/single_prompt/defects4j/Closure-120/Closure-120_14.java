## Fixed Function 1
boolean isAssignedOnceInLifetime() {
    Reference ref = getOneAndOnlyAssignment();
    if (ref == null) {
        return false;
    }
    // Make sure this assignment is not in a loop.
    for (BasicBlock block = ref.getBasicBlock(); block != null; block = block.getParent()) {
        if (block == ref.getBasicBlock()) {
            // Skip the block that contains the assignment
            continue;
        }
        if (block.isFunction) {
            break;
        } else if (block.isLoop) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Explanation: 
In the original implementation, the for loop will check if the assignment is in a loop by checking if the current block is a loop block. However, this will incorrectly return false if the assignment block is the only block in the loop, because the loop block will not be reached. 

To fix this issue, we need to skip the block that contains the assignment when checking for loop blocks. We can achieve this by adding an if statement that skips the block if it is the same as the block that contains the assignment.
