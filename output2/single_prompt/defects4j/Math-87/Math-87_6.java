## Fixed Function 1
private Integer getBasicRow(final int col) {
    Integer row = null;
    for (int i = getNumObjectiveFunctions(); i < getHeight(); i++) {
        if (Math.abs(getEntry(i, col)) > epsilon) {
            if (row == null) {
                row = i;
            } else {
                return null;
            }
        }
    }
    return row;
}

Explanation: 
- `MathUtils.equals` may not correctly compare very small or very large numbers due to floating-point precision issues. Instead, we can use `Math.abs` to compare the absolute values of the entries.
- We also changed the comparison condition to compare against the `epsilon` threshold rather than exact equality to account for floating-point precision issues.
