There are no immediate fixes that can be suggested without a better understanding of the project and its requirements. The code provided only shows a single function and its buggy implementation, but without context, it is difficult to determine what needs to be fixed. Please provide more information or context on the specific issue and requirements of the Closure project in order to better address the issue.
