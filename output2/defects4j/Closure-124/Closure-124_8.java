## Fixed Function 1
private boolean isSafeReplacement(Node node, Node replacement) {
    // No checks are needed for simple names.
    if (node.isName()) {
        return true;
    }
    Preconditions.checkArgument(node.isGetProp());
    Node child = node.getFirstChild();
    if (child.isName() && isNameAssignedTo(child.getString(), replacement)) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
} 

Explanation:
Previously the buggy function changed the value of the node by using its first child before checking if it was a `Name` type. To fix this issue we created a new node to store the first child of the node and made checks on that instead of changing the original node and introduced a new variable `child` to hold the first child of the node.
