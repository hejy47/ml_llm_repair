## Fixed Function 1
private void traverse(Node node) {
    if (!shouldVisit(node)) {
        return;
    }
    int visits = 0;
    do {
        Node c = node.getFirstChild();
        while (c != null) {
            traverse(c);
            Node next = c.getNext();
            c = next;
        }
        visit(node);
        visits++;
        Preconditions.checkState(visits < 10000, "too many iterations");
    } while (shouldRetraverse(node));
    exitNode(node);
} 

# Explanation
The fixed function only involves a minor typo which involves spelling mistake in the string literal passed into the Preconditions.checkState method. The original message was "too many interations" when it should have been "too many iterations".
