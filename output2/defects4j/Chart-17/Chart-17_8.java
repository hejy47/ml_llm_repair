## Fixed Function 1
@Override
public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    Chart chartClone = (Chart) super.clone();
    chartClone.data = this.data.clone();
    chartClone.style = this.style.clone();
    return chartClone;
} 

Note: This assumes that the Chart class has a data instance variable of an array type and a style instance variable that are both cloneable. If they are not cloneable, appropriate measures would need to be taken in the clone method to create deep copies.
