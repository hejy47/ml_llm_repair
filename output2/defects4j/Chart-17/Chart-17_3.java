## Fixed Function 1
public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    Chart clone = (Chart)super.clone();
    clone.data = (Data) this.data.clone();
    return clone;
} 

Note: This fix assumes that the Chart class has a "data" field of type Data, and that the Data class also implements the clone() method. The createCopy() method is not provided, so it is assumed to be buggy and replaced with a proper implementation of the clone() method.
