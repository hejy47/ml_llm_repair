## Fixed Function 1
public T[] sample(int sampleSize) throws NotStrictlyPositiveException {
    if (sampleSize <= 0) {
        throw new NotStrictlyPositiveException(LocalizedFormats.NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES, sampleSize);
    }
    final T[] out = (T[]) java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(singletons.get(0).getClass(), sampleSize);
    for (int i = 0; i < sampleSize; i++) {
        out[i] = sample();
    }
    return out.clone();
}

The fixed function adds the .clone() method when returning the output array. This is done to ensure that the output array is a copy of the actual sample, rather than a reference to the original sample. This is important because the sample method can modify its internal state, so referencing the original sample can lead to unexpected results. By returning a copy, the function ensures that the output is independent of the internal state of the original sample.
