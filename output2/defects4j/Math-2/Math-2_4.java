## Fixed Function 1
public double getNumericalMean() {
    return (double) getNumberOfSuccesses() / (double) getSampleSize();
} 

# Explanation 
The original function's formula for calculating the mean was incorrect as it was not taking into account the sample size and population size correctly. The fixed function simply calculates the mean based on the number of successes and sample size.
