There are multiple issues with the provided code, and it is difficult to provide a complete fix without more context. However, here are some potential fixes for some of the issues:

### Explanation
- There is a potential floating point equality issue with `previousEventTime`, so we create a copy of the variable to be used in comparisons.
- On some paths of execution, `previousEventTime` is updated but the new value is not propagated to the `previousEventTimeCopy` variable. We add a line to update it.
- There might be other issues with the code that are not immediately obvious without more context.
