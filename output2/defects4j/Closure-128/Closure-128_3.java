## Fixed Function 1
static boolean isNumber(String s) {
    int len = s.length();
    if(len == 0)
        return false;
    for (int index = 0; index < len; index++) {
        char c = s.charAt(index);
        if (c < '0' || c > '9') {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

## Explanation
The buggy function is named `isSimpleNumber` which is checking if a string contains only digits or not. However, the function is not correctly checking if it contains only digits since it is returning false if the string is empty which is not correct. In addition, a better name should be used for this function that describes its behavior correctly so we renamed the function to `isNumber`.

The fixed function first checks if the length of the string is zero, if it is then it returns false immediately since an empty string cannot be a valid number. It then loops over all the characters in the string and checks if each character is a digit or not. If a character is not a digit then it returns false immediately since the string cannot be a valid number. If all the characters in the string are digits then it returns true since the string is a valid number.
