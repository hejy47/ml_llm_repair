## Fixed Function 1
protected double getInitialDomain(double p) {
    double ret;
    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();
    // use mean
    if (d > 2) {
        ret = d / (d - 2.0);
    } else {
        ret = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
    }
    return ret;
} 

Note: Added a check for the value of d to avoid division by zero and to handle cases where the denominator is less than 2, which would lead to a negative result. In such cases, the function returns infinity.
